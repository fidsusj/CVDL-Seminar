	RepVGG introduces are re-parameterization method to transform a trained ResNet-like training-time model into a VGG-like plain CNN for inference. It therefore achieves a remarkable speed-accuracy trade-off for image classification and semantic segmentation while remaining easy to understand. As the first of its kind RepVGG achieves over 80\% accuracy on ImageNet while having a plain VGG-style architecture. This paper serves as a closer investigation of the original RepVGG paper and elaborates its highlights and weaknesses.
