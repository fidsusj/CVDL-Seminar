	RepVGG introduces a re-parameterization method to transform a trained ResNet-like training-time model into a VGG-like plain convolutional neural network for inference. It therefore achieves a remarkable speed-accuracy trade-off for image classification and semantic segmentation while remaining easy to understand. As the first of plain architecture based models, RepVGG achieves over 80\% accuracy on ImageNet \cite{JiaDeng.2009}. This paper serves as a closer investigation of the original RepVGG paper \cite{Zhang.2017} and elaborates its highlights and weaknesses.
